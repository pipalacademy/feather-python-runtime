# Feather Python Runtime
Python Runtime for [Feather](https://github.com/pipalacademy/feather) (previously WebREPL).

**Warning:** This runtime is meant to be deployed to already-sandboxed environments (such as
Lambda or Heroku). It might not be safe to run this on a long-running machine because it
runs user-supplied code without isolating its impact.
